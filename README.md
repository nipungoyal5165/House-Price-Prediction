# House-Price-Prediction
A Python code is developed by me utilizing a basic linear regression model to provide predictions on home prices. The model takes into consideration several criteria such as the space of the property, the number of bedrooms, bathrooms, levels, and parking places available. The demonstration showcases the standard procedures involved in a machine learning process, including data collection, normalization, partitioning data into training and testing sets, training the model, evaluating its performance, and visualizing the results.
